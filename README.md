# QCmriQC

Class project using deep learning (CNN &amp; autoencoder) to classify T1w MRI structural images as usable or not. Inspired by Drs. Esteban and Garcia. The goal is to incorporate IQMs from MRIQC proper instead of raw PNG images converted via med2image ([Link](https://github.com/FNNDSC/med2image))
